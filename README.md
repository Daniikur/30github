# 30 Days, 30 Projects

This repository documents my journey of building 30 different projects in 30 days. Through consistent practice and dedication, I aim to enhance my Java backend development skills while also improving problem-solving and coding efficiency.

## üöÄ Why Take on This Challenge?

### In Brief:
To become proficient in Java backend development and build a strong portfolio.

### In Detail:
This journey is focused on mastering Java backend development, including Spring Boot, REST APIs, databases, and cloud deployment. Additionally, it helps in building consistency and discipline, which are crucial for any developer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Since the primary focus is Java backend development, the projects will utilize:

- **Java** (Core Java, OOP, Multithreading)
- **Spring Boot** (REST APIs, MVC, Security)
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL** (Database Integration)
- **Docker & Kubernetes** (Containerization & Deployment)
- **AWS / Cloud Services** (Optional)
- **Maven / Gradle** (Build & Dependency Management)

There may also be additional technologies introduced as the journey progresses.

Stay tuned for updates as I work through these projects! üöÄ
