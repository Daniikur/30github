# Sample Java Application

This is a simple Java application that demonstrates basic functionality and can be used to monitor performance using VisualVM.

## Features
- Displays "Java App is running..." in the console.
- Continuously prints "App is still running..." to simulate an ongoing process.
- Can be used to practice performance profiling and monitoring using VisualVM.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Java 17 or higher (JDK)
- VisualVM for profiling

## Setup Instructions

## Monitor with VisualVM
Open VisualVM.
Under the Applications tab, ensure your Java app is listed.
Select the app and use the Profiler tab to profile the CPU or memory usage.
## Profiling Instructions
In VisualVM, go to the Profiler tab.
Start profiling by choosing either CPU or Memory.
Analyze which parts of your application consume the most resources.
## Troubleshooting
If VisualVM isn't detecting your app, ensure the application is running and that itâ€™s using the correct JDK version.
If profiling doesn't start, check the Application tab to ensure your Java process is correctly listed.
Ensure the JMX options are enabled for remote profiling, if needed.
